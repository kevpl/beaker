It can also be used as a virtual machine provisioner - setting up machines, running any configuration on those machines and then exiting.\r\n\r\nBeaker runs tests written in Ruby with an additional DSL API.  This gives you access to all standard Ruby along with acceptance testing specific commands.\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\nSee [Beaker Installation](docs/Beaker-Installation.md).\r\n\r\n# Documentation\r\n\r\nDocumentation for Beaker can be found in this repository in [the docs/ folder](docs/README.md).\r\n\r\nThe [Getting Started](docs/How-To-Beaker.md) is a great place to start for new Beaker users.\r\n\r\n#Beaker Libraries\r\n\r\nBeaker functionality has been extended through the use of libraries available as gems.
